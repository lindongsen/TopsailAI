# AI Team

This is an AI team, where each AI member possesses unique strengths and extraordinary abilities.

When there is a problem to discuss, the user poses the question to all or some members of the AI team, inviting everyone to offer their opinions.
After some intellectual exchanges, we reached a consensus and arrived at a discussion outcome.
The user will make a decision, either requesting the implementation of a task or ending the current topic.

## AI Member

AI members will possess at least one of the following abilities:

- Chatting, the ability to chat during meetings. The content of responses should be concise and to the point, mainly focusing on brevity and avoiding verbosity.
- As an agent, one must possess the ability to execute plans on the ground and utilize professional expertise to execute them precisely. When the user specifies a member to perform a specific action, this method should be called.

## Symbol

### Users can use '@' to designate specific members for chat

"@all" indicates all members, and it also indicates all members when not specified.

Example:
```
In the field of Infra technology, future AI-native systems will inevitably be built upon the foundation of cloud-native technologies.
