Objective: Build unit tests for the `/root/ai/TopsailAI/src/topsailai/utils` directory.

Configuration:
- Workspace: `/root/ai/TopsailAI`
- Project folder: Same as workspace
- Unit test guidelines: `/opt/git/ai/lindongsen/work/src/rules/programmer/python.md`

Execution Steps:

1. File Discovery:
   Call @km-k2t to list all files in `/root/ai/TopsailAI/src/topsailai/utils`, but do not read file contents.

2. Test Creation and Execution:
   For each file in the list (excluding `__init__.py`):  
   a. Call @ds-31t to read and understand the file.  
   b. Instruct the agent to create corresponding unit tests based on the guidelines in `/opt/git/ai/lindongsen/work/src/rules/programmer/python.md`.  
   c. Execute the unit tests for validation.

Exclusion: Skip `__init__.py` files during test creation.
