# CLI command surface rules

## Non-interactive first

Every command MUST be usable non-interactively before an interactive form is added.

The non-interactive surface is the contract: it is what scripts, CI jobs and other
programs can call, and it is the only surface that can be verified without a terminal.
An interactive form is a convenience layer over the same behaviour, never the place
where behaviour is first defined.

Consequences for a new command:

- Implement the standalone entry point first, with an explicit syntax, argument
  validation and a machine-readable `--json` mode.
- Reuse the same runner method from both surfaces so the two cannot diverge.
- Add the command to the standalone help order and to the dispatch switch in the
  same change, so an advertised command is always executable.
- Only then add the interactive spelling, scope rules and prompt-driven flow.
- A command that exists only interactively is a defect, not a design choice.

## Why the order matters

- A non-interactive-first command can be tested end to end without a terminal, so
  its behaviour is pinned by automated tests rather than by manual keystrokes.
- Automation cannot drive a prompt, so an interactive-only command is unreachable
  for scripts and forces callers to scrape terminal output.
- Defining behaviour once in the runner and exposing it twice prevents the two
  surfaces from drifting into different semantics.

## Failure semantics

A non-interactive command MUST NOT silently degrade to a weaker behaviour.

- If the stronger behaviour is unavailable, return an explicit error instead of
  returning cached or partial data under the same command name.
- A command named after an action must perform that action or fail; it must not
  quietly become a read of the previous result.
- Interactive surfaces may degrade with a visible diagnostic, because a human is
  present to read it. Non-interactive surfaces must fail, because no human is.

## Audit

The table records the verified state of every command. Each standalone entry was
executed against an unreachable Server, so the observed message proves the command
was dispatched rather than rejected as unknown.

| Command | Standalone spelling | Interactive spelling | Compliant |
|---|---|---|---|
| `list` | `list` | `list` | yes |
| `refresh` | `refresh` | `refresh`, `r` | yes |
| `endpoints` | `endpoints` | `endpoints` | yes |
| `show` | `show` | `show` | yes |
| `info` | `info` | `info` | yes |
| `logs` | `logs` | `logs` | yes |
| `status` | `status` | `status` | yes |
| `send` | `send` | `send` | yes |
| `context.inject` | `btw`, `inject` | `inject`, `btw` | yes |
| `execution.interrupt` | `control` | `interrupt`, `control` | yes |
| `agent.start` | `start` | `start` | yes |
| `agent.resume` | `resume` | `resume` | yes |
| `agent.stop` | `stop` | `stop` | yes |
| `help` | `help` | `help`, `?` | yes |
| `cd` | not applicable | `cd` | not applicable |
| `quit` | not applicable | `quit`, `exit`, `q` | not applicable |

Two spellings are intentionally asymmetric:

- `interrupt` is interactive-only as a spelling, but its behaviour is reachable
  standalone through `control`, which maps to the same `execution.interrupt`
  operation. The standalone surface therefore covers the behaviour even though it
  does not accept the interactive word.
- `inject` is accepted standalone as an alias of `btw`; both map to
  `context.inject`.

`cd` and `quit` navigate a session that only exists inside the interactive loop, so
they have no standalone meaning and are not gaps.

Removed spellings must stay rejected rather than silently reinterpreted: `table`
returns an explicit removal message pointing at `list --clean`, and `use` is
rejected as unknown in favour of `cd`.

## Verification

- The standalone help order and the dispatch switch must list the same commands.
- A test must prove each advertised syntax is executable, not merely printed.
- A test must prove a command that cannot perform its action returns an error
  instead of cached data.
- A new command must be added to the help order, the dispatch switch and the
  availability matrix in the same change.
